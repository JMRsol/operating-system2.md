## Skills, Frameworks, and Operating System

This document defines the core skills, frameworks, tone, and execution philosophy used by Jon-Michael Richardson.  
It is designed to function as a living operating system for strategy, automation, marketing, sales, and execution.

---

## 1. Core Identity

**Role**
- Automation Strategist
- Systems Architect
- Marketing & Sales Operator
- Community-Centered Builder

**Primary Strength**
Turning unclear ideas, messy operations, or stalled growth into structured, automated, and repeatable systems that scale.

**Bias**
- Clarity over cleverness
- Systems over hustle
- Execution over ideation
- Human context over raw automation

---

## 2. Operating Principles

- AI handles precision. Humans handle perspective.
- Automation handles the routine. Humans handle the rhythm.
- A single human with context is worth a thousand algorithms.
- Speed-to-lead beats perfect messaging.
- The system must work without the founder present.
- If it cannot be explained simply, it is not ready to ship.

---

## 3. Communication & Brand Tone

**Voice Characteristics**
- Direct
- Grounded
- Operator-to-operator
- Calm authority
- No hype, no fluff

**Style Rules**
- Short sentences
- Minimal functional words
- Plain language over jargon
- Explain the “why” before the “how”
- Teach through analogies and real-world examples

**Default Framing**
- Identify friction
- Name the cost of inaction
- Show a clear path forward
- Invite action without pressure

## 4. Core Frameworks

### 4.1 StoryBrand 2.0 (Donald Miller)

Used for:
- Websites
- Landing pages
- Email sequences
- Sales messaging
- Product clarity

**7-Part Structure**
1. Customer is the hero
2. Clear external, internal, and philosophical problem
3. Jon as the guide (empathy + authority)
4. Simple plan (process + agreement)
5. Clear call to action
6. Stakes of inaction
7. Transformation and success

Rule:  
If a stranger cannot understand the offer in 5 seconds, it fails.

### 4.2 Lead Magnet → Solution Ladder (Hormozi-Inspired)

Used for:
- Funnels
- ICP qualification
- Content strategy
- Sales efficiency

**Principles**
- Lead magnets solve a narrow but painful problem
- They reveal the next, larger problem
- Paid offers solve the system, not the symptom

**Three Lead Magnet Types**
- Problem-revealing diagnostics
- Free trials or samples
- One step of a multi-step process

---

### 4.3 Speed-to-Lead & Pipeline Health

Used for:
- CRM design
- Automation logic
- Revenue recovery

**Core Beliefs**
- Response time determines conversion rate
- Follow-up gaps are revenue leaks
- No system = emotional decision-making

**Metrics That Matter**
- Time to first response
- Number of follow-up attempts
- Multi-channel follow-up coverage
- Lead stage stagnation

---

### 4.4 Qualification-First Sales Framework

Used for:
- Real estate
- Regulated industries
- High-friction purchases

**Qualifying Signals**
- Timeline
- Authority
- Readiness
- Compliance constraints
- Willingness to engage

Goal:  
Disqualify early to protect time and margin.

### 4.5 The Big J Ad Framework (Internal Use)

Used for:
- Short-form video
- Sales pages
- Event promotion

**Sequence**
1. Pain or money hook
2. Identity + authority
3. Industry context
4. Proof of pain
5. “Show me time” moment
6. Demo or example
7. Solution snapshot
8. Clear CTA

---

## 5. Automation & Systems Skills

**Core Platforms**
- GoHighLevel (CRM, pipelines, SMS, email, calendars)
- Make.com (logic orchestration)
- n8n (advanced workflows)
- Supabase (data + auth)
- Notion (internal ops)
- ChatGPT (reasoning layer)

**System Design Principles**
- Human-in-the-loop by default
- Clear triggers, waits, and exits
- Idempotent workflows
- Fail-safe fallbacks
- Visibility before complexity

**Common Automations**
- Missed-call text back
- Lead qualification flows
- AI voice agents
- Review request triggers
- Pipeline movement alerts
- Compliance-aware messaging

---

## 6. ICP & Market Orientation

**Primary ICPs**
- Real estate agents and brokerages
- Regulated operators (cannabis-adjacent, compliance-driven)
- Service businesses with lead flow issues
- Community-centered operators scaling operations

**Shared Traits**
- Busy
- Under-automated
- Revenue leakage
- Poor follow-up
- Founder-dependent operations

---

## 7. Content & Teaching Philosophy

**Content Purpose**
- Build trust before selling
- Teach just enough to reveal the gap
- Reduce fear around systems and AI

**Formats**
- Short-form video
- Email
- Framework breakdowns
- Live demos
- Event-based education

Rule:  
Free content must be good enough that people feel stupid saying no to the paid offer.

---

## 8. Execution Bias

**Preferred Workflow**
1. Clarify the problem
2. Map the current system
3. Identify bottlenecks
4. Design the simplest fix
5. Automate last, not first
6. Measure, then scale

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
- Overbuilding before validation
- Tool hoarding
- Automation without ownership
- Emotion-led decisions
- Lose systems no one understands

---

## 9. Personal Operating Constraints

- ADHD-aware execution
- Systems must reduce cognitive load
- Tasks should be broken into visible wins
- Momentum matters more than perfection

Design rule:  
If the system requires constant motivation, it will fail.

This file is intentionally incomplete.  
It should evolve as new frameworks, tools, and lessons are earned through execution.

Update it. Refine it. Subtract often.
